    "<br>\n",
    "F1-Score is the harmonic mean of precision and recall and is meant to balance both the considerations of the model's recall and its precision. It measures the balance between precision and recall, which makes it a better evaluation tool than accuracy as the effects of false positives and false negatives often differ (i.e. one can have a more severe negative impact over the other). The formula is as follows: \n",

    "We will calculate the F1-score by using macro-averaged Precision and Recall values. <br>\n",

    "The confusion matrix is a table that shows how well our decision tree classifier performed across all classes.

    "Before training our logistic regression model, we need to normalize our features to ensure that gradient descent converges efficiently. Features in the breast cancer dataset have different scales (for example, area ranges from ~100 to ~2000 while smoothness ranges from ~0.05 to ~0.16), and these different scales can cause issues during training. When features have vastly different magnitudes, gradient descent can oscillate or converge very slowly because the gradients for large-scale features dominate the updates. Normalization addresses this by transforming all features to have mean 0 and standard deviation 1 using the formula: $x_{normalized} = \\frac{x - \\mu}{\\sigma}$, where $\\mu$ is the mean and $\\sigma$ is the standard deviation.\n",
    "\n",
    "A critical consideration when normalizing is preventing data leakage. Data leakage occurs when information from the validation or test sets influences the training process, which artificially inflates performance metrics and doesn't reflect real-world model performance. To prevent this, we compute the normalization parameters (mean and standard deviation) using only the training data, then apply those same parameters to normalize the validation and test sets. This ensures that our model has no knowledge of the validation or test distributions during training, which mirrors real-world deployment where we would normalize new incoming data using statistics saved from our original training set."

    "Our logistic regression model demonstrates excellent performance on the test set across all evaluation metrics. The model achieves an accuracy of 97.67%, correctly classifying the vast majority of breast cancer cases. The precision of 1.0 indicates that every case our model predicted as malignant was indeed malignant, meaning we had zero false positives. The recall of 94.12% shows that our model successfully identified 94.12% of all actual malignant cases, though it did miss approximately 5.88% of malignant cases (false negatives). The F1-score of 96.97% reflects the strong balance between precision and recall. Finally, the ROC-AUC of 99.66% demonstrates that our model has exceptional discriminative ability, nearly perfectly separating malignant from benign cases across all classification thresholds. These results indicate that our logistic regression implementation with L2 regularization and early stopping has successfully learned to distinguish between malignant and benign breast tumors with high reliability."

    "We compare our from-scratch implementation against scikit-learn's LogisticRegression to validate our implementation. While we configured sklearn with similar hyperparameters (L2 regularization with C=1/λ, same max iterations), we should not expect identical results for several reasons. First, sklearn uses the LBFGS optimization algorithm, which is a more sophisticated quasi-Newton method, while our implementation uses mini-batch gradient descent with batch size 32. Second, sklearn may employ different convergence criteria and numerical precision settings. Third, our early stopping based on validation loss may terminate training at a different point than sklearn's convergence criteria. Finally, even with the same random seed, the stochastic nature of mini-batch sampling in our implementation introduces variability. Despite these differences, if both models achieve similar performance metrics, it validates that our implementation correctly captures the core logistic regression algorithm and demonstrates that multiple optimization approaches can reach comparable solutions."

    "So all of our models except the RBF kernels with C=1.0 and gamma=1.0 performed well. We'll get into why that may be the case when we discuss how changing hyperparameters influence model performance. Now, our model is relatively balanced with a ratio of 10:7 for actual positive to actual negative: this means that we can still utilize Accuracy. Given the context that this is meant to predict Cancer diagnoses, it's extremely critical that we reduce False Negatives as those have a more adverse impact. Therefore, we'll be choosing the one with good overall metrics, but paying particularly close attention to the Recall scores and F1-Scores. \n",

    "Comparing our best linear model (C=0.1) with our best RBF model (C=1.0, gamma=0.01), we see nearly identical performance (both F1=97.64%). This suggests the decision boundary that separates malignant from benign tumors is approximately linear in the original 30-dimensional feature space.\n",
    "\n",
    "The linear kernel creates a single flat hyperplane that divides the space, while RBF with small gamma creates a smooth, gently curved surface. When these achieve the same performance, it indicates the data is linearly separable and doesn't require the additional flexibility of non-linear SVMs. The RBF kernel's ability to create complex, curved boundaries provides no advantage for this dataset and actually introduces the risk of catastrophic overfitting if gamma isn't tuned properly."

The decision boundary tends to be smoother and more generalizable because the model doesn't contort itself to fit every single training point perfectly.\n",

While this achieves higher training accuracy, it risks overfitting to noise in the training data.\n",

Note that the performance on this reduced data will be lower than our full 30-dimensional models since we're only capturing a portion of the total variance. However, this 2D representation allows us to visualize the decision boundaries, support vectors, and how different hyperparameters affect the geometry of the classification boundary."
